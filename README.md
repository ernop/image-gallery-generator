v0.23 changes: removed AI stuff. Now back to just showing the images.  And some other little fixes and stuff that people have asked for.

v0.22 changes:
1. fix AI image description lookup.  q looks up, and it displays, and also stores forever.

v0.21 changes:
1. fast save of an image using a keyboard shortcut (s), so you don't have to right-click save and pick the location - it just saves to your default download folder.  there are also notifs.
2. fixed webm display, which had temporarily been broken!
3. fixed preloading so hopefully it works better now. Still doesn't work for webm, really.
4. reset vertical scroll position to top when exiting the gallery
5. improved appearance of the font.
6. switched indexing on count variable from 0-based to 1-based.
7. the name of the gallery mode on the replies page now contains a suffix M/N where M is the number of images in the thread, and N is the number of videos.

# TODO
* different layouts?
* sort/search by filename/order/etc
* can we make it easier to download?  what does the alpha midjourney site do? it's amazing.
* can we set filters by filesize? (assuming user has set a minimum megapixel size)
* can we exclude filenames which are obviously autogenerated while still preserving other useful ones?
* can we add support for archive sites, too?
* what other sites would this be useful for?
* autoplay?
* youtube video description?
* webm support
