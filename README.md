# image-gallery-generator

# TODO
* sort/search by filename/order/etc
* can we make it easier to download?
* can we set filters by filesize? (assuming user has set a minimum megapixel size)
* can we exclude filenames which are obviously autogenerated while still preserving other useful ones?
* what other sites would this be useful for?
* autoplay?
* youtube video description?
* webm support

# DONE
* preload first few images fullsize
* save options between runs
* fix up code
